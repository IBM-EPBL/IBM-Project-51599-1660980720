 # Problem Statement :
 
 
               Due to the fast growing urbanization supply of safe drinking water is a challenge for the every city authority. Water can be polluted any time. So the water we reserved in the water tank at our roof top or basement in our society or apartment may not be safe. Still in India most of the people use simple water purifier that is not enough to get surety of pure water. Sometimes the water has dangerous particles or chemical mixed and general purpose water purifier cannot purify that. And itâ€™s impossible to check the quality of water manually in every time. So an automatic real-time monitoring system is required to monitor the health of the water reserved in our water tank of the society or apartment. So it can warn us automatically if there is any problem with the reserved water. And we can check the quality of the water anytime and from anywhere.
